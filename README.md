The MVC project, API project, and unit test project have been added to my solution. Due to SQL connection issues on my office laptop, I have added default values to the try catch block.
API End Point :

To get all customer details with order  - https://localhost:7214/api/Customers
To get specific customer details with order - https://localhost:7214/api/Customers/1
To get Order details - https://localhost:7214/api/Orders
To get specific order - https://localhost:7214/api/Orders/1
To place Order using Post Method - https://localhost:7214/api/Orders



Unit Test Done for API  using Xunit.
